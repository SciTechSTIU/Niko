# STIUApp
STIUApp is a web application created to help advisors choose which courses to offer to students in the future. 
It allows advisors to view the courses a student has taken as well as detailed information about a given course. The app also shows a list of courses ordered by the number of students who haven't taken it yet which means that they should be offered in the future term.

STIUApp is created using ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework for database and Bootstrap Framework for visual layout.
